# Sample Ads Dataset

This dataset contains a very small synthetic sample used for testing the Kasparro Agentic System.

Columns:
- date  
- campaign_name  
- platform  
- creative_type  
- audience_type  
- creative_message  
- spend  
- impressions  
- clicks  
- purchases  
- revenue  
- roas  

This dataset is intentionally simple to allow agent-based components to run end-to-end.
